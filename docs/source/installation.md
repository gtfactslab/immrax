# Installation

## Setting up a `conda` environment

We recommend installing JAX and `immrax` into a `conda` environment ([miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)).
```shell
conda create -n immrax python=3.11
conda activate immrax
```

## Installing JAX

Follow the instructions from the [JAX documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). For GPU support, the easiest will likely be to install the CUDA/CUDNN libraries using pip, instead of a local installation. 

For a full installation of CUDA into the `conda` environment using `pip`,
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

If you just want CPU support, the install is much simpler. Just run
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade "jax[cpu]"
```

## Installing `immrax`

For now, manually clone the Github repository and `pip install` it. We plan to release a stable version on PyPi soon.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gtfactslab/immrax.git
cd immrax
pip install .
```

To test if the installation process worked, run the `compare.py` example.

```shell
cd examples
python compare.py
```

This should return the outputs of different inclusion functions as well as their runtimes.

## Installing `cyipopt` and `coinhsl` (optional)

If you would like to run the [pendulum optimal control example](Pendulum), you need to install IPOPT and the MA57 linear solver from HSL.

First, install `cyipopt` (more instructions [here](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)).
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt
```
This command can take a while to fully resolve.

To use the MA57 solver, you'll first need to acquire a package from [HSL](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/). While there are instructions [here](https://cyipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#conda-forge-binaries-with-hsl), we highly recommend to instead use [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) to install HSL globally. 
Then, use a symbolic link to help the `conda` environment locate it.
```shell
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libcoinhsl.so $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libcoinhsl.so
```
