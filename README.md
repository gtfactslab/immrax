# immrax

`immrax` is a tool for interval analysis and mixed monotone reachability analysis in JAX.

Inclusion function transformations are composable with existing JAX transformations, allowing the use of Automatic Differentiation to learn relationships between inputs and outputs, as well as parallelization and GPU capabilities for quick, accurate reachable set estimation.

For more information, please see the full [documentation](https://immrax.readthedocs.io).

## Dependencies

`immrax` depends on the library `pypoman`, which internally uses `pycddlib` as a wrapper around [the cdd library](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/fukudak/cdd_home/). For this wrapper to function properly, you must install `cdd` to your system. On Ubuntu, the relevant packages can be installed with

```bash
apt-get install -y libcdd-dev libgmp-dev
```

On Arch linux, you can use

```bash
pacman -S cddlib
```

## Installation

### Setting up a `conda` environment

We recommend installing JAX and `immrax` into a `conda` environment ([miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)).

```shell
conda create -n immrax python=3.12
conda activate immrax
```

### Installing immrax

`immrax` is available as a package on PyPI and can be installed with `pip`.

```shell
pip install immrax
```

If you have cuda-enabled hardware you wish to utilize, please install the `cuda` optional dependency group.

```shell
...
pip install immrax[cuda]
```

To test if the installation process worked, run the `compare.py` example. The additional `examples` optional dependency group contains some dependencies needed for the more complex examples; be sure to also install it if you want to run the others.

```shell
cd examples
python compare.py
```

This should return the outputs of different inclusion functions as well as their runtimes.
