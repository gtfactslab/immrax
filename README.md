# immrax

`immrax` is a tool for interval analysis and mixed monotone reachability analysis in JAX.

Inclusion function transformations are composable with existing JAX transformations, allowing the use of Automatic Differentiation to learn relationships between inputs and outputs, as well as parallelization and GPU capabilities for quick, accurate reachable set estimation.

For more information, please see the full [documentation](https://immrax.readthedocs.io).

## Dependencies

`immrax` depends on the library `pypoman`, which internally uses `pycddlib` as a wrapper around [the cdd library](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/fukudak/cdd_home/). For this wrapper to function properly, you must install `cdd` to your system. On Ubuntu, the relevant packages can be installed with 

```bash
apt-get install -y libcdd-dev libgmp-dev
```

On Arch linux, you can use 

```bash
pacman -S cddlib
```


## Installation

### Setting up a `conda` environment

We recommend installing JAX and `immrax` into a `conda` environment ([miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)).

```shell
conda create -n immrax python=3.11
conda activate immrax
```

### Installing immrax

For now, manually clone the Github repository and `pip install` it. We plan to release a stable version on PyPi soon.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gtfactslab/immrax.git
cd immrax
pip install .
```


If you have cuda-enabled hardware you wish to utilize, please install the `cuda` optional dependency group.

```shell
...
pip install .[cuda]
```

To test if the installation process worked, run the `compare.py` example.

```shell
cd examples
python compare.py
```

This should return the outputs of different inclusion functions as well as their runtimes.
